# AI-x-Data---Supervised-Model
Built a supervised model consisting of a random forest ensemble using XGboost and utilitized K-Folds and Randomzied Search to optimize accuracy up to 96.5 percent. Complemented by strong feature engineering and further model tuning, my team won the Supervised Model cateogry with an excellent model and presentation.
